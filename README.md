Python is a highly popular dynamic programming language used by numerous large organizations, such as Google, Yahoo, and IBM. It is compatible with all major operating systems and often comes pre-installed on Macs, as well as most Linux and Unix-based systems.

Python is a widely popular introductory programming language due to its intuitive syntax, ease of use, and similarity to other programming languages. It is an excellent gateway language because it's not only easy to learn but also easy to transfer your Python skills to other languages you might program with in the future. If you have some computer skills, such as understanding file systems, writing formulas in Excel, or setting up a router, you are well-equipped to start learning Python. Having prior programming knowledge is also beneficial, as it will help you understand how programming concepts work in other languages.

This course is designed for learners with various levels of computer science knowledge, including those with front-end development backgrounds or gaps in their understanding. It's meant to be taken sequentially, with each section building on the previous one and lots of references to what has been done in the past. The course starts from the foundations and works to give learners a strong programming background. To truly understand Python, learners are encouraged to put in the effort and complete practice exercises and application challenges.
